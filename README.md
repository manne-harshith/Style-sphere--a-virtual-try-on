# Online Virtual Try-On System for Shirts

This is a web-based platform designed to enhance online shopping by enabling users to visualize shirts in real-time using their webcam before making a purchase. The system integrates computer vision to provide an interactive and realistic try-on experience, leveraging augmented reality to engage users with fashion in a novel way.

## Features

- **Real-time Virtual Try-On**: Visualize shirts on your webcam feed.
- **Image Processing**: Powered by OpenCV for tasks like flipping, resizing, and overlaying images.
## Technologies

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image and video processing, allowing the application to capture and analyze webcam input.
- **Web Development**: Built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that handles HTTP requests, routing, and rendering of HTML templates.
- **Frontend Interaction**: JavaScript for interactive, real-time webcam visualization.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the Application**: Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Clothing Items**: Extend the try-on to other garments.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Enhance image processing for more accurate fit and alignment.
